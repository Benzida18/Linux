# My Linux Learning Journey

Welcome to my Linux learning repository! This space documents everything I‚Äôve explored so far as I build up my skills in Linux system usage, scripting, and server management.

## What I‚Äôve Learned So Far

### Linux Basics
- Navigating the file system using `cd`, `pwd`, `ls`
- Creating and managing files and directories with `touch`, `mkdir`, `mv`, `cp`, `rm`
- Using wildcards and command-line shortcuts
- Understanding and using `man`, `--help`, and `type` for help and command info

### File Permissions and Ownership
- Viewing permissions with `ls -l`
- Changing permissions using `chmod`
- Changing ownership with `chown`
- Using symbolic and numeric permission formats

### User Account Management
- Creating and deleting users (`useradd`, `userdel`)
- Modifying user details (`usermod`)
- Setting and changing passwords
- Locking and unlocking user accounts
- Managing groups and assigning users to them

### Data Stream Redirection
- Redirecting output with `>`, `>>`
- Redirecting input with `<`
- Redirecting errors using `2>`
- Suppressing output using `/dev/null`
- Combining streams (`&>`)

###  Disk and System Usage
- Checking disk usage with `df`, `du`
- Viewing memory and CPU usage with `free`, `top`
- Monitoring system processes

### Shell Scripting
- Writing and executing basic shell scripts (`.sh` files)
- Using `echo`, variables, conditionals (`if`, `else`), and loops
- Automating common admin tasks

### Git Basics
- Configuring Git with `git config`
- Initialising a repository with `git init`
- Creating commits and pushing to GitHub
- Handling merge conflicts and rebasing

### Projects and Labs
Each folder in this repository represents a specific topic or project I've worked on:
- `data-stream-redirection/` ‚Äì Exercises on redirecting input/output/error streams
- `file-permissions/` ‚Äì Examples of managing Linux file permissions
- `user-management/` ‚Äì Hands-on labs related to Linux user accounts
- `projects/server-information-retrieval/` ‚Äì A small script project to retrieve and display server system info
- More folders coming soon...

## üí° Why I‚Äôm Learning This

My goal is to become confident in Linux system administration and automation, which are core foundations for DevOps, cloud computing, and cybersecurity. This repo serves as my personal notebook and portfolio of progress.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- Terminal (macOS / Linux shell)
- Bash scripting
- Git + GitHub for version control and tracking
